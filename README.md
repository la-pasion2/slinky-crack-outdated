# Slinky Crack (Outdated)
This is a reupload of a previously cracked version of Slinky, originally cracked by PlutoSolutions.
This repository contains only pre-compiled binaries.

# Disclaimer
As this repository does not contain source code, it is provided "as-is" and "use at your own risk." I have not made any modifications to the original files.

This crack is an outdated version of Slinky and does not include many of the newer features. See [Modules](#modules) for details.

Injecting the cheat too early (before minecraft has fully initialised) can result in crashes, to be safe just inject after minecraft has done initialising.

# Information (From Slinky Documentation)
Cheats like Slinky may be falsely flagged as malware. If you experience errors when running the loader, you may need to add an exclusion in Windows Defender or other antivirus software.

You may need to exclude the following files and directories:

The Slinky Loader (.exe file)

The directory: %USERPROFILE%\.slinky\bin

Loading Slinky
Once the loader injects successfully, you should see an in-game notification indicating the keybind to open the menu. By default, this is Right Shift (RSHIFT), but you can change it as needed.

# Usage
When running slinkyloader.exe, the program will attempt to locate slinkyhook.dll and slinkylibrary.dll from the same directory slinkyloader.exe is located. If these files are missing, the program will try to generate them from raw bytes.

If this process fails, manually place slinkyhook.dll and slinkylibrary.dll in the same directory as slinkyloader.exe.
